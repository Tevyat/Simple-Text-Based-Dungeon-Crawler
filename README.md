# Simple-Text-Based-Dungeon-Crawler
Name says it all. Just a text-based dungeon crawler made using python

Encounters or events are quite limited seeing as there are only 4. Will be improved on version 3.0 (if there will be)


There is a "class" system. Although due to the limited amount of encounters or events, it is quite one-dimensional meaning the stats really only either do this or that, nothing more, nothing less.


I should add a dog encounter.


The types function is pretty cool. But sometimes it gets a little annoying.


Lots of things to be improved on.


To see the path to victory, just type "konami code". I definitely like this feature.


To run the code, just to https://www.online-python.com and copy + paste the code.
